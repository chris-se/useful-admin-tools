fkumount (Forcibly Killing UMOUNT)
----------------------------------

Umount a mount point. This Python [1] script umounts a directory. If the
mount point is busy, it tries to find out which processes are still
accessing it and kills them (if possible). It then tries to umount the same
mount point again and again until that is either successful or a timeout is
reached. (It tries multiple times to kill the processes accessing that mount
point.)

Multiple mount points may be specified. With threading, this utility tries
to unmount those mount points simultaneously. The reationale for this is
that in some circumstances, the mount utility itself may hang on some mount
points (if there is a kernel problem) and this guarantees that every mount
point that can be umounted sanely, will be. (The threading part is why it's
written in Python.)

If certain mount points do not exist, they will be ignored. If no valid
mount points are specified, an error will be returned.

If certain paths are not mountpoints, they will be ignored but no error will
be raised. This means that once this utility completes with exit status 0,
there is definitely nothing mounted at the given paths.

It may seem that fuser -mk $PATH && umount $PATH should achieve the same,
but fuser -m does not find all processes that still access the mount point -
only lsof +f -- $PATH will find all (?) of them. This utility makes use of
lsof and provides convenience functionality around it.

Note that while several retries in acquiring the process list are done (to
catch the case when a process forks at the wrong time), the entire logic is
still prone to race conditions. There is no guarantee that this will always
work properly - especially against malicious programs.

Some may refer to the -l option of umount in recent versions; that is not
what this utility is supposed to do. The idea behind this utility is that
after a successful run the underlying device file can be safely removed
without any data loss (other than what may have occurred by killing the
processes still accessing it). The -l option leaves the device file still in
use, it only frees up the path on additional accesses. Both have their uses,
but this tool does something different.

[1] Should work with any Python version from 2.3 onwards; but so far tested
only with 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.
